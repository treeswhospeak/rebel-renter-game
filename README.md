This game was made as my final project for Urban Sociology, Spring 2024.
Throughout the game, the player is given the chance to connect with other members of their community, which, if done right, will allow them to begin to solve the problem of growing rent prices in their neighborhood.

To play the game, download rebel_renter.exe, and open it. It will automatically run in your system's Terminal or Command Prompt. Progress through the game by typing your responses to prompts given, and hitting Enter.

Have fun, and eat the rich.
Thank you!
